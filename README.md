# Worst-Game-Ever-1
A "game" you play in the command prompt made in Lua


If you've for some reason taken the time to install Lua and properly run the file in a command prompt, you can witness the amazing controls this game has. 
You see, this game requires you to press the enter button after ever single input to achieve proper movement.
You can move in a total of 2 entire directions and there is literally nothing else to do but move left and right.

Controls:

a + enter : move left

d + enter : move right

Goal of the game:

literally nothing what were you thinking
